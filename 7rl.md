###  How I explained REST to my brother (https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550)
1.  Who is Roy Fielding?  (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding)
    -  Roy Thomas Fielding (born 1965) is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer (REST) architectural style. He is an authority on computer network architecture and co-founded the Apache HTTP Server project.
2.  Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
    -  They weren't designed to do that.  You just need to be able to talk to a small group of machines.  You need a way to have one machine tell another machine what you need off of yet another machine.
3.  What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
    -  HTTP, which is all about applying verbs to nouns.  For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.
4.  What does a GET POST PUT and PATCH do? (https://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)
