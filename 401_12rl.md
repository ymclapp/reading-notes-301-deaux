#  Readings: Entity Framework and APIs

## Readings
1.  MVC with EF Get Started  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/intro
    -  Provides a specific example of creating a webpage
2.  If you have time, read the preceding articles under this category as well.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/
    -  Provides a specific example of creating a webpage too
3.  Entity Framework Core  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio
    -  With EF Core, data access is performed using a model
    -  A model is made up of entity classes and a context object that represents a session with the database
    -  The context object allows querying and saving data
    -  Querying - Instances of your entity classes are retrieved from the database using Language Integrated Query (LINQ)
    -  Saving data - Data is created, deleted, and modified in the database using instances of your entity classes
4.  Data Seeding  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/data-seeding
    -  Data seeding is the process of populating a database with an initial set of data
    -  There are several ways this can be accomplished in EF Core:
        -  Model seed data
            -  Limitations of model seed data
                -  This type of seed data is managed by migrations and the script to update the data that's already in the database needs to be generated without connecting to the database. This imposes some restrictions:

                -  The primary key value needs to be specified even if it's usually generated by the database. It will be used to detect data changes between migrations.
                -  Previously seeded data will be removed if the primary key is changed in any way.
                -  Therefore this feature is most useful for static data that's not expected to change outside of migrations and does not depend on anything else in the database, for example ZIP codes.

                -  If your scenario includes any of the following it is recommended to use custom initialization logic described in the last section:

                -  Temporary data for testing
                -  Data that depends on database state
                -  Data that is large (seeding data gets captured in migration snapshots, and large data can quickly lead to huge files and degraded performance).
                -  Data that needs key values to be generated by the database, including entities that use alternate keys as the identity
                -  Data that requires custom transformation (that is not handled by value conversions), such as some password hashing
                -  Data that requires calls to external API, such as ASP.NET Core Identity roles and users creation
        -  Manual migration customization
        -  Custom initialization logic
5.  Entity Framework Core  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-rp/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1&tabs=visual-studio
    -  Provides a specific example of creating razor pages
6.  YouTube - Intro to APIs (60 min)  https://youtu.be/aIkpVzqLuhA
    -  
7.  User Secrets  https://codefellows.github.io/code-401-dotnet-guide/resources/user-secrets.html
    -  User secrets is a secure way of storing private user information such as API keys, client secrets, and connection strings
    -  Essentially anything that you donâ€™t want others to know about when using your code base
    -  Provides specific steps to "Enable" User Secrets
