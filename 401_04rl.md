#  Readings: Classes & Memory Management

##  Readings
1.  Classes  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/classes
    -  [Reference Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#reference-types)
    -  [Declaring Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#declaring-classes)
    -  [Creating Objects](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#creating-objects)
    -  [Class Inheritance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#class-inheritance)
    -  [Example](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#example)
    -  [C# Language Specification](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/types/classes#c-language-specification)
2.  Constructors  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors
    -  Whenever a class or struct is created, its constructor is called. A class or struct may have multiple constructors that take different arguments. Constructors enable the programmer to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read
    -  [Constructor Syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors#constructor-syntax)
    -  [Static Constructors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors#static-constructors)
    -  [In This Section - shows some good examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/constructors#in-this-section)
3.  Properties  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties
    -  A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write, or compute the value of a private field. Properties can be used as if they are public data members, but they are actually special methods called accessors. This enables data to be accessed easily and still helps promote the safety and flexibility of methods.
    -  [Properties Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#properties-overview)
    -  [Properties with Backing Fields](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#properties-with-backing-fields)
    -  [Expression Body Definitions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#expression-body-definitions)
    -  [Auto-Implemented Properties](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/properties#auto-implemented-properties)

4.  Stack and Heap  https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/C-Sharp-heaping-vs-stacking-in-net-part-i/
    -  The Stack is more or less responsible for keeping track of what's executing in our code (or what's been "called")
    -  The Heap is more or less responsible for keeping track of our objects (our data, well... most of it - we'll get to that later.)

5.  Garbage Collection Fundamentals  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/garbage-collection/fundamentals
    -  
    -  The garbage collector provides the following benefits:
        -  Frees developers from having to manually release memory.
        -  Allocates objects on the managed heap efficiently.
        -  Reclaims objects that are no longer being used, clears their memory, and keeps the memory available for future allocations. Managed objects automatically get clean content to start with, so their constructors don't have to initialize every data field.
        -  Provides memory safety by making sure that an object cannot use for itself the memory allocated for another object.
    -  Garbage collection occurs when one of the following conditions is true:
        -  The system has low physical memory. This is detected by either the low memory notification from the OS or low memory as indicated by the host.
        -  The memory that's used by allocated objects on the managed heap surpasses an acceptable threshold. This threshold is continuously adjusted as the process runs.
        -  The GC.Collect method is called. In almost all cases, you don't have to call this method, because the garbage collector runs continuously. This method is primarily used for unique situations and testing.
    -  A garbage collection has the following phases:
        -  A marking phase that finds and creates a list of all live objects.
        -  A relocating phase that updates the references to the objects that will be compacted.
        -  A compacting phase that reclaims the space occupied by the dead objects and compacts the surviving objects. The compacting phase moves objects that have survived a garbage collection toward the older end of the segment.
