##  Readings
1.  View Models  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/overview?view=aspnetcore-2.2
    -  In ASP.NET Core MVC, views are .cshtml files that use the C# programming language in Razor markup. Usually, view files are grouped into folders named for each of the app's controllers. The folders are stored in a Views folder at the root of the app.
    -  The Home controller is represented by a Home folder inside the Views folder. The Home folder contains the views for the About, Contact, and Index (homepage) webpages
    -  Use layouts to provide consistent webpage sections and reduce code repetition. Layouts often contain the header, navigation and menu elements, and the footer
    -  Partial views reduce code duplication by managing reusable parts of views
    -  View components are similar to partial views in that they allow you to reduce repetitive code, but they're appropriate for view content that requires code to run on the server in order to render the webpage
    -  Views help to establish separation of concerns within an MVC app by separating the user interface markup from other parts of the app
    - Views that are specific to a controller are created in the Views/[ControllerName] folder. Views that are shared among controllers are placed in the Views/Shared folder. To create a view, add a new file and give it the same name as its associated controller action with the .cshtml file extension. To create a view that corresponds with the About action in the Home controller, create an About.cshtml file in the Views/Home folder
