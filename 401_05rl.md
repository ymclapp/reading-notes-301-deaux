What is a Linked List?
A linked list is a sequence data structure, which connects elements, called nodes, through links. Unlike an array data structure, a node in a linked list isn’t necessarily positioned close to the previous element or the next element. Nodes in a linked list are connected by pointers. Linked lists are null terminating, which means whenever the pointer to the next node is null, the list has reached the end.

In single linked list, element or nodes only link to the next element in the list. A single linked list is null terminating meaning when the pointer is null, the list is finished.

A linked list is kind of like a scavenger hunt. You have a clue, and that clue has a pointer to place to find the next clue. So you go to the next place and get another piece of data, and another pointer. To get something in the middle, or at the end, the only way to get to it is to follow this list from the beginning (or to cheat ;) )

What is a practical, real world example of the Linked List?

The simplest and most straightforward is a train.

Train cars are linked in a specific order so that they may be loaded, unloaded, transferred, dropped off, and picked up in the most efficient manner possible.

For instance, the Jiffy Mix plant needs sugar, flour, cornmeal, etc. Just around the bend might be a paper processing plant that needs chlorine, sulfuric acid, and hydrogen.

Now, we can stop the train, unload each car of its contents, then let the train go on, but then everything else on the train has to sit while flour is sucked out of the caisson, then the sugar, etc.

Instead, the cars are loaded on the train in order so that a whole chunk of it can be detached, and the remainder of the train moves on.

The end of the train is easier to detach than a portion in the middle, and vastly easier than detaching a few cars in one spot, and a few cars in another spot.

If needed, however, you can insert and remove items at any point in the train.

Much like a linked list.

The way Blame moves around a bunch of software engineers working on different modules in a project.

First, the GUI guy gets blamed for the product not working. He checks his code and sees it's not his fault: the API is screwing up. The API guy checks his code: not his fault, it's a problem with the logger module. Logger module guy now blames database guy, who blames installer guy, who blames...
