# Consider the history: That Time When Women Stopped Coding
https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2014/10/21/357629765/when-women-stopped-coding

A lot of computing pioneers — the people who programmed the first digital computers — were women. And for decades, the number of women studying computer science was growing faster than the number of men. 

The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

In the '70s, that never would have happened: Professors in intro classes assumed their students came in with no experience. But by the '80s, that had changed.

In the early 80's pc's were so dominant that professors assumed that students came in with having played with computers at home in their youth.  Most men did, but the women did not have that experience and that started them in a deficit.

Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

Diverse teams are smarter and more creative 

According to Scott E. Page, professor of complex systems, political science and economics at the University of Michigan: "Diverse groups of people bring to organizations more and different ways of seeing a problem and, thus, faster/better ways of solving it."

Diverse companies perform better

“female representation in top management leads to an increase of $42 million in firm value.”

Companies are losing out on great talent 

Diverse companies can better serve a diverse user base 

It’s the right thing to do 

While diversity and inclusion efforts are most often driven by business rationales, we’ve spoken with a few CEOs who are motivated primarily by a belief that cultivating an inclusive tech community is simply the right thing to do.

But it’s only a first step. After deciding that diversity matters and articulating its importance, leaders must create a strategy for building a more diverse, inclusive company and an accountability plan to ensure that strategy is effective.
