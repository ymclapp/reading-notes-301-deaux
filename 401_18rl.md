#  Readings: Identity
##  Readings
1.  Intro to Identity  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/?view=aspnetcore-2.1
    -  Authentication is the process of determining a user's identity. Authorization is the process of determining whether a user has access to a resource. In ASP.NET Core, authentication is handled by the IAuthenticationService, which is used by authentication middleware. The authentication service uses registered authentication handlers to complete authentication-related actions. Examples of authentication-related actions include:

Authenticating a user.
Responding when an unauthenticated user tries to access a restricted resource.
2.  Identity Demystified  https://digitalmccullough.com/posts/aspnetcore-auth-system-demystified.html
    -  Identity
        -  Key to understanding how authentication works is to first understand what an identity is in ASP.NET Core 2.0. There are three classes which represent the identity of a user: Claim, ClaimsIdentity, and ClaimsPrincipal
        -  A Claim represents a single fact about the user. It could be the user's first name, last name, age, employer, birth date, or anything else that is true about the user
        -  An Identity represents a form of identification or, in other words, a single way of proving who you are. In real life this could be a driver's license. In ASP.Net Core, it is a ClaimsIdentity. This class represents a single form of digital identification
        -  A Principal represents the actual user. It can contain one or more instances of ClaimsIdentity, just like in life a person may have a driver's license, concealed-carry permit, social security card, and a passport. Each of the identities is used for a different purpose and may contain a unique set of claims, but they all identify the same user in some form or another
        -  There are 5 verbs (these can also be thought of as commands or behaviors) that are invoked by the auth system, and are not necessarily called in order.  Note: These are behaviors, not methods (although there are methods of the same names implementing these behaviors).
            1.  Authenticate
                -  Gets the user’s information if any exists (e.g. decoding the user’s cookie, if one exists)
            2.  Challenge
                -  Requests authentication by the user (e.g. showing a login page)
            3.  SignIn
                -  Persists the user’s information somewhere (e.g. writes a cookies)
            4.  SignOut
                -  Removes the user’s persisted information (e.g. deletes the cookies)
            5.  Forbid
                -  Denies access to a resource for unauthenticated users or authenticated but unauthorized users (e.g. displaying a “not authorized” page)
