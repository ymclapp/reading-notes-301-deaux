##  Readings
1.  Azure Dev Ops  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/?view=azure-devops
    -  Azure DevOps provides developer services for support teams to plan work, collaborate on code development, and build and deploy applications. Azure DevOps supports a culture and set of processes that bring developers and project managers and contributors together to complete software development. It allows organizations to create and improve products at a faster pace than they can with traditional software development approaches.
    -  Choose Azure DevOps Services when you want the following outcomes:
        -  Quick set-up
        -  Maintenance-free operations
        -  Easy collaboration across domains
        -  Elastic scale
        -  Rock-solid security
2.  MVC Basics  https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/learn-basics-of-mvc-architecture/
    -  MVC is a design pattern or architecture which helps in developing the web application in a most efficient way when compared with the traditional ASP.NET Web Application.
    -  Basically, MVC makes the design of the application into three layers namely Model, View, and Controller. Each of these components are built to handle different aspects of the application.
    -  Model layer represent the objects in our Application. Model is also a class which has all the objects and its properties and methods defined in it.

    -  View Layer has all the html controls which define the UI of the application. Here in MVC, we don’t have drag and drop option for controls as we don’t use server controls. Instead we use Razor Engine available with Visual Studio by default which helps in rendering the View.

    -  Views are files with .cshtml extensions. .cshtml contain both html and server code.

    -  And also, using ‘@’, we can access C# code so that in our page which can access server side dynamic data.

    -  Controller basically handles the request from user. It is the heart of the MVC application as everyone say. It is responsible to handle the request and return a response to user by loading appropriate View with data from Model.

    -  Controller is nothing but a class with a group of methods called actions. And Every action method returns view. A View can be anything like it can be xml or html or JSON etc.

    -  Controller maps the incoming user requests to appropriate Controller actions with the help of process called Routing.

    -  Routing process internally creates a table called ‘Route Table’ which describes which action to be taken for each request from user. The route table is created during the Application Start event. Routes are URL patterns created dynamically based on incoming request.
3.  Tag Helpers  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/tag-helpers/intro?view=aspnetcore-2.1
    -  Tag Helpers enable server-side code to participate in creating and rendering HTML elements in Razor files. For example, the built-in ImageTagHelper can append a version number to the image name. Whenever the image changes, the server generates a new unique version for the image, so clients are guaranteed to get the current image (instead of a stale cached image).
4.  Bootstrap  https://getbootstrap.com/
    -  For installing Bootstrap
5.  1 Hour tutorial Bootstrap  https://scrimba.com/g/gbootstrap4
    -  
6.  Build sites with Bootstrap  https://aspnetcore.readthedocs.io/en/stable/client-side/bootstrap.html
    -  The recommended way to install client-side dependencies like Bootstrap in ASP.NET Core is via Bower (using bower.json..)
    -  Article also includes examples of code and syntax for nav bar, etc.
