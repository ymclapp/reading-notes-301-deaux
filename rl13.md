# Sending Form Data
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Sending_and_retrieving_form_data


The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the page containing the form — the current page.
<br><br>
Ex:
<br>
1. <form action="https://example.com"> - to some other page outside of our page
2. <form action="/somewhere_else"> - to another page within our site
3. <form> - just leaves on form page

The method attribute defines how data is sent. The HTTP protocol provides several ways to perform a request; HTML form data can be transmitted via a number of different methods, the most common being the GET method and the POST method
<br><br>
Ex:
<br>
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="GET">

The POST method is a little different. It's the method the browser uses to talk to the server when asking for a response that takes into account the data provided in the body of the HTTP request: "Hey server, take a look at this data and send me back an appropriate result." If a form is sent using this method, the data is appended to the body of the HTTP request.
<br><br>
Ex:
<br>
<form action="http://www.foo.com" method="POST">

Viewing HTTP requests
1. Open the developer tools.
2. Select "Network"
3. Select "All"
4. Select "foo.com" in the "Name" tab
5. Select "Headers"

## Method Override
The concern is that on forms there is no understanding of the PUT/PATCH and DELETE, so there needs to be a middleware that interprets a delete command from the form and processes it as a delete.  Same with PUT/PATCH.
1. CRUD - Create, Read, Update, Delete
	1. SQL = INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
	2. Rest/HTTP = POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, DELETE
	3. Brower Forms= POST, GET, ?, ? = change PUT/PATCH and DELETEs into POSTs

To do this, you put the hidden input into the HTML of the form, npm install method-override, and update server.js.

server.js
const methodOverride = require('method-override');  <<--put this after const express = ...  <<--see New Project Steps in this notebook

app.use(methodOverride('_method')); <<--HAS TO BE AFTER the JSON body parser  <<--see New Project Steps in this notebook  <-_method is the name that we gave in in the above HTML for the hidden input


HTTP Request - three parts
1. Path (/, /home, /search?q = dfoij)
2. Headers (Content-Type, Accept)
3. Body (optional:  POST, PUT, PATCH)

HTTP Response - three parts
1. Status Code (200, 404, 500, 302)
2. Headers (Content-Type, Set-Cookies)
3. Body(optional)
Keith mentioned this as part of the Method-Override where the app.use(methodOverride('x-HTTP-Method-Override')) will be treated like a header.  The x is what makes it be treated like a header.  It is video 14 around the 25 minute mark.
