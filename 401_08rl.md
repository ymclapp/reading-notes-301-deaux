#  Readings: Collections & Enums

##  Readings
1.  C# 7.0 In a Nutshell - Ch. 7 Collections(pg. 301-313, pg 324-327,) If you have time to read the whole chapter â€“ I recommend it.
2.  C# 7.0 in a Nutshell: Pg 118-124
3.  Collections  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/collections
    -  There are two ways to group objects: by creating arrays of objects, and by creating collections of objects
    -  Arrays are most useful for creating and working with a fixed number of strongly typed objects
    -  A collection is a class, so you must declare an instance of the class before you can add elements to that collection
    -  If your collection contains elements of only one data type, you can use one of the classes in the System.Collections.Generic namespace. A generic collection enforces type safety so that no other data type can be added to it. When you retrieve an element from a generic collection, you do not have to determine its data type or convert it.
4.  Enums  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/enum
    -  An enumeration type (or enum type) is a value type defined by a set of named constants of the underlying integral numeric type. To define an enumeration type, use the enum keyword and specify the names of enum members:
-  enum Season
-  {
    -  Spring,
    -  Summer,
    -  Autumn,
    -  Winter
-  }
    -  By default, the associated constant values of enum members are of type int; they start with zero and increase by one following the definition text order. You can explicitly specify any other integral numeric type as an underlying type of an enumeration type
    -  You cannot define a method inside the definition of an enumeration type. To add functionality to an enumeration type, create an extension method
