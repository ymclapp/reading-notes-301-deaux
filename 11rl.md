###  nosql vs sql (https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)
1.  Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or
SQL	vs NoSQL
    1.  SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational o
    2.  SQL databases are table based databases whereas NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores.
    3.  SQL databases have predefined schema whereas NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data.
    4.  SQL databases are vertically scalable whereas the NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable
    5.  SQL databases uses SQL ( structured query language ) for defining and manipulating the data, which is very powerful. In NoSQL database, queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). The syntax of using UnQL varies from database to database

 	 
2.  What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
    -  Table related data with a schema for the template
3.  Give a real world example.
    -  Class students and grades
4.  What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
    -  NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data
5.  Give a real world example.
    -  Employee data
6.  Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
    -  NoSQL
7.  Which type of database is best for scalability?
    -  SQL

###  Videos
sql vs nosql (Video) (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS_kXvOeQ5Y)
1.  What does SQL stand for?
    -  Structure Query Language
2.  What is a relational database?
    -  Works with SQL
3.  What type of structure does a relational database work with?
    -  Tables
4.  What is a ‘schema’?
    -  What data and where it goes into - a template/data normalization
5.  What is a NoSQL database?
    -  The collection of key-value pair, documents, graph databases or wide-column stores which do not have standard schema definitions which it needs to adhered to
6.  How does it work?
    -  
7.  What is inside of a Mongo database?
    -  Documents based on json and is not in columns and rows
8.  Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why. (https://hevodata.com/learn/mongodb-vs-sql/#:~:text=SQL%20Databases%20Record&text=While%20MongoDB%20is%20more%20flexible,ensures%20greater%20reliability%20of%20transactions.)
    -  While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions
9.  What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
    -  NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID)
