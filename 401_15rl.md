    -  Common Terminology:
        -  Node - A Tree node is a component which may contain itâ€™s own values, and references to other nodes
        -  Root - The root is the node at the beginning of the tree
        -  K - A number that specifies the maximum number of children any node may have in a k-ary tree. In a binary tree, k = 2.
        -  Left - A reference to one child node, in a binary tree
        -  Right - A reference to the other child node, in a binary tree
        -  Edge - The edge in a tree is the link between a parent and child node
        -  Leaf - A leaf is a node that does not have any children
        -  Height - The height of a tree is the number of edges from the root to the furthest leaf
