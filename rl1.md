# Readings: RESPONSIVE WEB DESIGN and FLOATS

## Responsive vs Adaptive vs Mobile
There was much information on responsive vs adaptive vs mobile web design.  I thought it was interesting the difference between these when they seem to be used a bit interchangeably, which is incorrect.  The best thing I read was "When building a responsive website it should adjust to an array of different viewport sizes, regardless of the device. Breakpoints should only be introduced when a website starts to break, look weird, or the experience is being hampered.".

## Floats
Floats and grids are very important, I have found.  I don't think I can ever know enough about them.  There is so much to learn and so many resources to reference.  I really enjoyed this one on floats -> https://css-tricks.com/all-about-floats/
