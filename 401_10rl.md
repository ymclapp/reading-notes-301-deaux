##  Implementation: Stacks and Queues

Read: Stacks and Queues  https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-10/resources/stacks_and_queues.html
-  A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous
-  Common terminology for a stack is:
    -  Push - Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
        -  Pushing a Node onto a stack will always be an O(1) operation. This is because it takes the same amount of time no matter how many Nodes (n) you have in the stack
        -  When adding a Node, you push it into the stack by assigning it as the new top, with its next property equal to the original top
        -  Here is the pseudocode to push a value onto a stack:

            >ALOGORITHM push(value)
            >// INPUT <-- value to add, wrapped in Node internally
            >// OUTPUT <-- none
            >node = new Node(value)
            >node.next <-- Top
            >top <-- Node

    -  Pop - Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped. When you attempt to pop an empty stack an exception will be raised.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for a pop:
        >ALGORITHM pop()
        >// INPUT <-- No input
        >// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
        >// EXCEPTION if stack is empty
        >
        >Node temp <-- top
        >top <-- top.next
        >temp.next <-- null
        >return temp.value
    -  Top - This is the top of the stack.
    -  Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the top Node in the stack. When you attempt to peek an empty stack an exception will be raised.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for a peek

        >ALGORITHM peek()
        >// INPUT <-- none
        >// OUTPUT <-- value of top Node in stack
        >// EXCEPTION if stack is empty

        >return top.value
    -  IsEmpty - returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty:
        >ALGORITHM isEmpty()
        >// INPUT <-- none
        >// OUTPUT <-- boolean
        >
        >return top = NULL

-  Common terminology for a queue is:

    1.  Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for the enqueue method:
        >ALGORITHM enqueue(value)
        >// INPUT <-- value to add to queue (will be wrapped in Node internally)
        >// OUTPUT <-- none
        >node = new Node(value)
        >rear.next <-- node
        >rear <-- node
    2.  Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for the dequeue method:
        >ALGORITHM dequeue()
        >// INPUT <-- none
        >// OUTPUT <-- value of the removed Node
        >// EXCEPTION if queue is empty
        >
        >Node temp <-- front
        >front <-- front.next
        >temp.next <-- null
        >
        >return temp.value
    3.  Front - This is the front/first Node of the queue.
    4.  Rear - This is the rear/last Node of the queue.
    5.  Peek - When you peek you will view the value of the front Node in the queue. If called when the queue is empty an exception will be raised.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for a peek:
        >ALGORITHM peek()
        >// INPUT <-- none
        >// OUTPUT <-- value of the front Node in Queue
        >// EXCEPTION if Queue is empty
        >
        >return front.value
    6.  IsEmpty - returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
        -  Here is the pseudocode for isEmpty:
        >ALGORITHM isEmpty()
        >// INPUT <-- none
        >// OUTPUT <-- boolean
        >
        >return front = NULL
