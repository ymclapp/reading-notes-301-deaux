My reading notes pages will be a collection of questions, observations, code snippets, etc. as I push the 301 coding information into my head.

## Code 102 - Intro to Software Development
## Code 201 - Foundations of Software Development
## Code 301 - Intermediate Software Development
## Code 401 - Advanced Software Development

- [ ] Add **Career** notes
- [ ] Add notes from **Reading** assignments
- [ ] Add **Interesting** code

To be able to ensure that I get my reading notes done, I need to:
1.  Put the assignment on my planner
2.  Put a reminder into my calendar
3.  Just do it!
