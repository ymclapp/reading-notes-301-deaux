##  Readings
-  HTTP Cookies  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cookies
    -  An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to a user's web browser. The browser may store the cookie and send it back to the same server with later requests. Typically, an HTTP cookie is used to tell if two requests come from the same browser—keeping a user logged in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.
    -  Cookies are mainly used for three purposes:
        1.  Session management - Logins, shopping carts, game scores, or anything else the server should remember
        2.  Personalization - User preferences, themes, and other settings
        3.  Tracking - Recording and analyzing user behavior
-  The Set-Cookie and Cookie headers
    -  The Set-Cookie HTTP response header sends cookies from the server to the user agent. A simple cookie is set like this:
        -  Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>

    -  Origin of cookies
        -  One of the biggest issues in the early days of the web was how to manage state. In short, the server had no way of knowing if two requests came from the same browser. 
    -  Lou Montulli, an employee of Netscape Communications at the time, is credited with applying the concept of “magic cookies” to web communication in 1994. The problem he was attempting to solve was that of the web’s first shopping cart, now a mainstay on all shopping sites.
-  .NET Cookies Simplified  https://asp.mvc-tutorial.com/httpcontext/cookies/
    -  Pretty much all server-side technologies have built-in support for handling cookies and of course the ASP.NET MVC framework does as well. In fact, dealing with cookies is pretty easy, thanks to the functionality found on the HttpContext class. In this article, you'll learn how to set a cookie and then read it again afterwards, so that you will be able to share information about a specific visitor between his/hers requests.

-  Predict … How can we use cookies in our web application in a similar manner to how we used Bearer Tokens to make direct API calls?
    -  I expect that we will remember a user and offer them suggestions for their purchases, similar to Amazon or other apps that watch what their customers buy.
