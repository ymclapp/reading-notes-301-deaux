#  Implementation: Graphs

##  Resources
-  Read: Graphs  https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-35/resources/graphs.html
    -  A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be looked at as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges.
    -  Here is some common terminology used when working with Graphs:
        1.  Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
        2.  Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.
        3.  Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.
        4.  Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.
    -  Additional terms defined and illustrated:
        -  Directed vs Undirected
        -  Complete vs Connected vs Disconnected
        -  Acyclic vs Cyclic
        -  Weighted Graphs
        -  Traversals - Depth First/Breadth First
    - Graph Representation
        -  We represent graphs through:
            1.  Adjacency Matrix
            2.  Adjacency List
    -  Real World Uses of Graphs
        1.  GPS and Mapping
        2.  Driving Directions
        3.  Social Networks
        4.  Airline Traffic
        5.  Netflix uses graphs for suggestions of products
