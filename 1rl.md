# Readings: Introduction to React and Components

## Reading

### Component Based Architecture - (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
1.  What is a component?
    -  Components let you split the US into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation.  Like JavaScript functions.

2.  What are the characteristics of a component? - (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
    -  Reusability − Components are usually designed to be reused in different situations in different applications. However, some components may be designed for a specific task.
    -  Replaceable − Components may be freely substituted with other similar components.
    -  Not context specific − Components are designed to operate in different environments and contexts.
    -  Extensible − A component can be extended from existing components to provide new behavior.
    -  Encapsulated − A A component depicts the interfaces, which allow the caller to use its functionality, and do not expose details of the internal processes or any internal variables or state.
    -  Independent − Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

3.  What are the advantages of using component based architecture? - (https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)
    -  Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
    -  Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components

#### Note: Always start component names with a capital letter.
React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope.

### What is Props and How to Use it in React
1.  What is props short for?
    -  Properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another (https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)
2.  How are props used in React?
    -  Components accept a single prop object argument with data and returns a React element (https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
3.  What is the flow of props?
    -  Uni-directional flow - one way from parent to child (https://itnext.io/what-is-props-and-how-to-use-it-in-react-da307f500da0)
