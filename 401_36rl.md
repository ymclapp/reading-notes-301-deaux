# Readings: JAM Stack

What is the JAM Stack?  https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-is-the-jamstack-and-how-do-i-host-my-website-on-it/
    -  JAMstack is a software architecture and philosophy that adheres to the following components: Javascript, APIs, and Markup.
    -  That React app that you compile down with Webpack and ultimately serve from S3? Yup, that’s a JAMstack app. That simple HTML file that has no JavaScript and literally doesn’t do anything dynamic? Yup, that’s also a JAMstack app.
    -  JAMstack is not always going to be serverless
    -  It's typically comprised of 3 components: Javascript, APIs, and Markup

    -  AMstack apps inherently satisfy most if not all of the 5 pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework. These are core concepts that AWS considers to deliver fast, secure, high-performing, resilient, and efficient infrastructure.
