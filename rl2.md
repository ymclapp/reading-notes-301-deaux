#### Article: “6 Reasons for Pair Programming”

##### How does pair programming work?
While there are many different styles, pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code. The Navigator uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

1. Greater efficiency
    - Produces higher-quality code that doesn’t require later effort in troubleshooting and debugging (let alone exposing users to a broken product)
2. Engaged collaboration
    - When developers pair program, they rely more on each other and can often find a solution together without needing to ask for additional help
3. Learning from fellow students
    - The less experienced developer benefits from the experienced developer’s knowledge and guidance, and the latter benefits from explaining the topic in their own words, further solidifying their own understanding
4. Social skills
    - When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key
5. Job interview readiness
    - A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen
6. Work environment readiness
    - Many companies that utilize pair programing expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product
