#  Readings: Interfaces

##  Readings
1.  Interfaces  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/interfaces/
    -  By using interfaces, you can, for example, include behavior from multiple sources in a class. That capability is important in C# because the language doesn't support multiple inheritance of classes. In addition, you must use an interface if you want to simulate inheritance for structs, because they can't actually inherit from another struct or class.
2.  Back to Basics  https://simpleprogrammer.com/back-to-basics-what-is-an-interface/
    -  The basic problem an interface is trying to solve is to separate how we use something from how it is implemented
    -  Why do we want to separate the use from the implementation?
    -  So that we can write code that can work with a variety of different implementations of some set of responsibilities without having to specifically handle each implementation
    -  To put this more simply, this means that if we have a Driver class it should be able to have a method Drive that can be used to drive any car, boat, or other kind of class that implements the IDriveable interface.
    -  The Driver class should not have to have a DriveBoat, DriveCar or DriveX methods for each kind of class that supports the same basic operations that are needed for it to be driven
    -  Interfaces are trying to solve a very specific problem by allowing us to interact with objects based on what they do, not how they do it
    -  Interfaces are contracts:  Interfaces allow us to specify that a particular class meets certain expectations that other classes can rely on
    -  Interfaces are always implemented by more than one class
