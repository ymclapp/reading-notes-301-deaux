###  Status Codes Based On REST Methods (https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/)
1.  In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
    -  100’s = Headers and stuff have been received
    -  200’s = Yeah! You are successful!
    -  300’s = Not available and you are being redirected
    -  400’s =  Can't find/no authorization
    -  500’s =  Server error
2.  What is a status code 202?
    -  Accepted - Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future
3.  What is a status code 308?
    -  Permanent Redirect - This is the right code if the resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future
4.  What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
    -  204 No Content - A proper code for updates that don’t return data to the client, for example when just saving a currently edited document.
5.  What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
    -  410 Gone - This is like 404 but we know that the resource existed in the past, but it got deleted or somehow moved, and we don’t know where
6.  What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
    -  403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource

### Build A REST API With Node.js, Express, & MongoDB - Quick - First 20 minutes (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFbNIlppjAuEX4znoulh0Cw)
1.  Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
    -  So that it is not displayed for any user to see/use
2.  What is middleware?
    -  The window from your app to the api to have information move back and forth
3.  What does app.use(express.json()) do?
    -  Tells your app that you want the informaiton to be in json when using express to get info
4.  What does the /:id mean in a route?
    -  It is the id of the individual entry in the dataabase.
5.  What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?
    -  A PATCH request is considered a set of instructions on how to modify a resource (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PATCH)
    -  PUT request method creates a new resource or replaces a representation of the target resource with the request payload (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods/PUT)
6.  How do you make a defalut value in a schema?  (https://mongoosejs.com/docs/defaults.html
)
    -  Your schemas can define default values for certain paths. If you create a new document without that path set, the default will kick in.
    -  Note: Mongoose only applies a default if the value of the path is strictly undefined
7.  What does a 500 error status code mean?
    -  Server error
8.  What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201? (https://www.moesif.com/blog/technical/api-design/Which-HTTP-Status-Code-To-Use-For-Every-CRUD-App/)
    -  200 OK - It’s the basic status code to tell the client everything went good
    -  201 Created - This code should signal backend-side resource creation and come along with a Location header that defines the most specific URL for that newly created resource
