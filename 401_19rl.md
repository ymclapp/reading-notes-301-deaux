#  Readings: Roles, Claims and JWT Tokens

##  Readings
1.  Claims-Based auth  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authorization/claims?view=aspnetcore-2.1
    -  Claims based authorization, at its simplest, checks the value of a claim and allows access to a resource based upon that value.
    -  An identity can contain multiple claims with multiple values and can contain multiple claims of the same type
2.  Intro to Claims  https://andrewlock.net/introduction-to-authentication-with-asp-net-core/
    -  Authentication is the process of determining who you are, while Authorisation revolves around what you are allowed to do, i.e. permissions. Obviously before you can determine what a user is allowed to do, you need to know who they are, so when authorisation is required, you must also first authenticate the user in some way
    -  You can think of claims as being a statement about, or a property of, a particular identity. That statement consists of a name and a value. For example you could have a DateOfBirth claim, FirstName claim, EmailAddress claim or IsVIP claim. Note that these statements are about what or who the identity is, not what they can do
3.  JWT Authentication  https://codeburst.io/jwt-to-authenticate-servers-apis-c6e179aa8c4e
    -  JSON Web Token (JWT) is a means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. The claims in a JWT are encoded as a JSON object that is digitally signed using JSON Web Signature (JWS) and/or encrypted using JSON Web Encryption (JWE)
