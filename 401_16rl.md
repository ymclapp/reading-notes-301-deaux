##  Readings
1.  Data Transfer Objects  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-api/overview/data/using-web-api-with-entity-framework/part-5
    -  Sometimes you want to change the shape of the data that you send to client
    -  To accomplish this, you can define a data transfer object (DTO). A DTO is an object that defines how the data will be sent over the network

2.  How to use DTOs  https://www.infoworld.com/article/3562271/how-to-use-data-transfer-objects-in-aspnet-core-31.html
    -  A Data Transfer Object (commonly known as a DTO) is usually an instance of a POCO (plain old CLR object) class used as a container to encapsulate data and pass it from one layer of the application to another. You would typically find DTOs being used in the service layer to return data back to the presentation layer. The biggest advantage of using DTOs is decoupling clients from your internal data structures.
    -  Why use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)?
        -  When designing and developing an application, if you’re using models to pass data between the layers and sending data back to the presentation layer, then you’re exposing the internal data structures of your application. That’s a major design flaw in your application.
        -  By decoupling your layers DTOs make life easier when you’re implementing APIs, MVC applications, and also messaging patterns such as Message Broker. A DTO is a great choice when you would like to pass a lightweight object across the wire — especially when you’re passing your object via a medium that is bandwidth-constrained.
