# Debugging
https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c

To debug your JS code, the easiest and maybe the most common way its to simply console.log() the variables you want to check or, by using chrome developer tools, open your page with your JS code (press cmd+o in macOS or Ctrl+o in Windows) and choose your file to debug, click the line you wanna debug and refresh your page again (F5).

In Visual Studio, you can press the debug tab and add the below configuration:
"version": "0.2.0",
"configurations": [
    {
        "type": "node",
        "request": "launch",
        "name": "Launch Program",
        "program": "${workspaceRoot}/index.js"
    }
]
}

# Call Stack

Call stack is the path that it took you to get to a particular point where the process broke or you put in a break point.  The error will generally show you where it has travelled through to get to the point that is broken/breakpoint.

# Call Stack

The key takeaways from the call stack are:
1. It is single-threaded. Meaning it can only do one thing at a time.
2. Code execution is synchronous.
3. A function invocation creates a stack frame that occupies a temporary memory.
4. It works as a LIFO â€” Last In, First Out data structure.


# Call Stack

Example
function greeting() {
   // [1] Some code here
   sayHi();
   // [2] Some code here
}
function sayHi() {
   return "Hi!";
}

// Invoke the `greeting` function
greeting();

// [3] Some code here

The code above would be executed like this:

Ignore all functions, until it reaches the greeting() function invocation.
Add the greeting() function to the call stack list.
Call stack list:
- greeting

Execute all lines of code inside the greeting() function.
Get to the sayHi() function invocation.
Add the sayHi() function to the call stack list.
Call stack list:
- sayHi
- greeting

Execute all lines of code inside the sayHi() function, until reaches its end.
Return execution to the line that invoked sayHi() and continue executing the rest of the greeting() function.
Delete the sayHi() function from our call stack list.
Call stack list:
- greeting

When everything inside the greeting() function has been executed, return to its invoking line to continue executing the rest of the JS code.
Delete the greeting() function from the call stack list.
Call stack list:
EMPTY

In summary, then, we start with an empty Call Stack. Whenever we invoke a function, it is automatically added to the Call Stack. Once the function has executed all of its code, it is automatically removed from the Call Stack. Ultimately, the Stack is empty again.
