Node JS defined:
"Stackoverflow = Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.
Node site = Node.js® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

You can check that Node is installed on your system by opening a terminal and typing node -v. If all has gone well, you should see something like v12.14.1 displayed. This is the current LTS version at the time of writing.

Use a node manager such as npm.  Download and check that it is downloaded with npm -v.

npm init -y   <<--This will create and auto-populate a package.json file in the same folder.

What Is Node.js Used For?
Designed to automate the process of developing a modern JavaScript application.

Node.js Lets Us Run JavaScript on the Server

Node.js, however, is single-threaded. It’s also event-driven, which means that everything that happens in Node is in reaction to an event.

Node’s execution model causes the server very little overhead, and consequently it’s capable of handling a large number of simultaneous connections.

Node is particularly suited to building applications that require some form of real-time interaction or collaboration — for example, chat sites, or apps such as CodeShare, where you can watch a document being edited live by someone else. 

Another of Node’s big pluses is that it speaks JSON. JSON is probably the most important data exchange format on the Web, and the lingua franca for interacting with object databases (such as MongoDB)."
