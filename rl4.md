# Heroku
I had previously used this for City Explorer, the book app, and then later when I was trying to create my own stuff to get up to speed more on databases and APIs.

I used a pipeline for my work.  I know that I need review apps and then want to have a development and production app.

I have it in my notes to make sure that I get my API keys so that I can update those in the .env file and then in all three locations of Heroku in the configs area.

We can't do much in Heroku until we have our database set up and make sure that it is connecting correctly in the local host.

We will get very familiar with Heroku if we do City Explorer or similar app this time too.

My Heroku is all ready to go!!
