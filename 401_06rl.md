#  Readings: Object Oriented Principles

##  Readings
-  Inheritance
    -  The idea is that you're going to spend a tremendous amount of time writing your class, only to find that someone wants it changed by just a little bit to make the code useable in their application
    -  Inheritance will allow you to write a new class that contains all of the information from the original class, with extra variables
-  Abstract
    -  to indicate a class that is intended only to be a base class of other classes (has to be extended by other classes)
-  Polymorphism
-  OOP Principles
    -  A class is nothing more than a blueprint, or a design, for an object. People often talk about a class being similar to a blueprint for a house. A house's blueprint describes things like how many levels there are, where the doors and windows are located, and other things like that
    -  Each of these things is a particular characteristic or property of the house. And realize that you can use one blueprint to make as many houses as you like. Each individual house is known as anÂ object
    -  It means that your class will define all of the characteristics and behaviors that are associated with it. Here, we usually think of characteristics as being properties and behaviors as being subroutines or events.
