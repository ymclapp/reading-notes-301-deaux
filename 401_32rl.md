##  Readings
1.  Intro to View Components  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/views/view-components?view=aspnetcore-2.1
    
    -  A view component:
        -  Renders a chunk rather than a whole response.
        -  Includes the same separation-of-concerns and testability benefits found between a controller and view.
        -  Can have parameters and business logic.
        -  Is typically invoked from a layout page.
    -  View components are intended anywhere you have reusable rendering logic that's too complex for a partial view, such as:
        -  Dynamic navigation menus
        -  Tag cloud (where it queries the database)
        -  Login panel
        -  Shopping cart
        -  Recently published articles
        -  Sidebar content on a typical blog
        -  A login panel that would be rendered on every page and show either the links to log out or log in, depending on the log in state of the user
    -  A view component consists of two parts: the class (typically derived from ViewComponent) and the result it returns (typically a view). Like controllers, a view component can be a POCO, but most developers will want to take advantage of the methods and properties available by deriving from ViewComponent.
