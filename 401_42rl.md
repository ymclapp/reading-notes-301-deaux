###  Ethics in the workplace
1.  The code I’m still ashamed of  https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-code-im-still-ashamed-of-e4c021dff55e
    -  This article was interesting, but really felt that the example that he provided is probably pretty common in different industries.  I applaud him for resigning, but as everyone knows, where someone refuses, someone else is willing.  You can't stop stuff like this by walking away from it.  You have to make the commitment to report it.  Hopefully something happens, but at least you had the ethics to stand up and say this is wrong.

4.  Big Data is our Civil Rights issue  http://solveforinteresting.com/big-data-is-our-generations-civil-rights-issue-and-we-dont-know-it/
    -  I thought this was a very interesting article.  Just like anything, information can be manipulated and portrayed the way the originator wants to show it.  The article showed a graphic of the Berlin wall with the surnames of people on either side.  It was to show how the wall kept out foreigners.  Very interesting and public data, but who will take the time to look into it further to see if it was skewed through the illustration.
